# H2KWebsite
- Under Construction - 
The H2K website is a soccer website with videos and photos from Georgia State University's Division I Men's Soccer team, which has currently been implemented using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap4. It will be updated to create a more visually aesthetic interface and easy to use functions in the back-end using JavaScript, and many other tools.
